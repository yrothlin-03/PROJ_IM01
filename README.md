# PROJECT IM01 - Telecom Paris

In this project, we tried to implement an old method to estimate motion blur kernel and then deblur images with Split-Bregman method for TV-Deconvolution.

Code explanations : 
- kernel_estimation : implements the different functions for the kernel estimation method described in the article article_lr.pdf.
- tv_deconv : implements the split-bregman method.
- utils : contains different useful function to load and process images.
- test : contains different test functions to evaluate different benchmakrs.
- main : containing the principal code to apply automatically the whole method.

Brief summary of the method : 

## Motion blur kernel estimation 


## TV-deconvolution by Split-Bregman method
