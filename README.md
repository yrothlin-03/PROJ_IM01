# PROJECT IM01 - Telecom Paris

In this project, we tried to implement an old method to estimate motion blur kernel and then deblur images with Split-Bregman method for TV-Deconvolution.



Brief summary of the method : 

## Motion blur kernel estimation 


## TV-deconvolution by Split-Bregman method
